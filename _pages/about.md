I am a third year PhD candidate at Yale University working with 
[Prof. Abhishek Bhattacharjee](https://cs.yale.edu/homes/abhishek) in the 
[Computer Systems Lab](https://csl.yale.edu/). Previously, I obtained my BS/MS 
from the University of Michigan, where I worked with Prof. Baris Kasikci and 
Prof. Tanvir Ahmed Khan.

Research
======

My research interest is in hardware-software co-design, specifically for 
[neural interfaces](https://www.sigarch.org/the-brain-computer-interfacing-landscape-for-computer-architects). 
I am currently working on designing scalable neural signal processors for both 
clinical treatment and scientific study through the 
[HALO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eenFPogXcq4) project (partial tapeout 
at 12 nm). Previously, I worked on profile-guided optimizations in hardware 
and software for data center applications.
