I am a first year PhD student at Yale University working with [Prof. Abhishek Bhattacharjee](https://cs.yale.edu/homes/abhishek) in the Computer Systems Lab. Previously, I obtained my BS/MS from the University of Michigan, where I worked with Prof. Baris Kasikci, Prof. Mosharaf Chowdhury, Prof. Harsha Madhyastha, and Tanvir Ahmed Khan.

Research
======

My research interests are in computer systems, specifically at the intersections of computer architecture, operating systems, compilers, and machine learning. Right now, I am interested in the systems challenges of [brain-computer interfaces](https://www.sigarch.org/informing-brain-computer-interface-design-with-insights-from-computer-architecture-research). Topics that I have worked on include profile-guided optimizations and hardware/software co-design for data center applications.
