I am currently a research assistant at the University of Michigan, working with [Prof. Baris Kasikci](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~barisk/), [Prof. Mosharaf Chowdhury](https://www.mosharaf.com/), and [Tanvir Ahmed Khan](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~takh/). Previously, I completed my M.S. (Winter 2021) at the University of Michigan. Before that, I graduated with my B.S. (Winter 2020) at the same institution, where I completed my Honors Thesis advised by [Prof. Harsha Madhyastha](https://harshavm.engin.umich.edu/). 

**I am applying to Ph.D. programs for Fall 2022. Please contact me if you are looking for students interested in systems research.**

Research
======

My research interests are in computer systems, specifically at the intersections of computer architecture, operating systems, compilers, and machine learning. Right now, I am interested in performance optimizations for datacenter applications, including ML workloads. Topics that I am working on include profile-guided optimizations, hardware/software co-design, and MLSys.
