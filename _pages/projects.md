**(Active) Profile-guided Hints for Branch Prediction:** Researching methods of supplying profile-guided hints to state-of-the-art branch predictors in modern processors through hardware/software co-design. **Preparing submission for early 2022.**

**(Active) ML Input Pipeline Profiling:** Profiling the input fetch and pre-processing bottlenecks in ML training workloads using NVIDIA's DALI library to determine potential optimizations.

**PGO for CPU Inference:** Applied profile-guided techniques to ML Inference on CPUs to improve latency across MLPerf benchmarks. Applied strategic auto-vectorization to TensorFlow and PyTorch to improve inference performance.

**Linux Kernel PGO:** Applied compiler-based profile-guided optimizations to the Linux kernel to improve the performance of a set of datacenter applications. The goal was to strategically curate a multi-application kernel profile to benefit a set of diverse applications without overfitting and hindering the performance of any of the chosen applications. Accepted into the **2021 PLDI SRC** ([Poster](https://meugur.github.io/files/PLDI-2021-poster.pdf)).
